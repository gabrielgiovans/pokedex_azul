# pokedex_azul

The pokemon library

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

This app was developed using:

* TDD

* Repository Design Parent
    - I chose this Pattern because it encapsulates the data access layer well, then leaving the business rule free in case a problem happens and it is necessary to change it

*SOLID

* State management done with flutter_tripple
    - I chose this status manager due to its low complexity of use and because it meets the needs of the app well.

* Used flutter_modular for knowledge purposes (I liked it a lot by the way).
